# Let Me Count The Ways (Scala)

An attempt to aggregate all of the ways to do various things in Scala.

* [Functions](app/Functions.scala)

To run any of the apps locally:

    ./sbt run

Or to run a specific app:

    ./sbt "runMain Functions"

## Notes

Things that do not count as being a different way to do something (unless it actually is different):
* Whitespace e.g. new lines, indention, etc
* Nested wrapping e.g. `((foo))`

I'm sure there are other ways to do things so please send Pull Requests for the things I missed.
